<h4 align="left">Where do I stand now</h4>

- I can't do much yet, but I'm working on it!


<h4 align="left">Where do I stand, more specifically</h4>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning (about) **Python, ML & AI**
- 👩‍🎓 I’m working on master's thesis on information extraction from food menus 📖 and preparing to finish my **Computational Linguistics** studies at Faculty of Arts at Masaryk university, Brno
- 🔍 **I’m looking for the first full-time job / part-time job / side projects / internship 🤩**
  - Do you have a job that I might be a good fit for? Feel free to contact me, I am open to a range of opportunities.
  - I feel like I would be most beneficial in a medium-sized company to which I could already be of some value and where I could grow to more technical/professional positions or positions that would be a good fit to my skills/abilities
- 🤝 In my free time, I try to solve 🎄 [Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/Scharka/AoC)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Czech language and I enjoy spreading it around - I teach Czech to foreigners. 👩‍🏫 I also know too much about the language to be a grammar Nazi, so don't worry!
