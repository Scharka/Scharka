## Who I am

I’m a Czech language tutor for foreigners. I’ve studied Czech language and linguistics, and I’ve been teaching since **2018**.

I help adults who live and work in the Czech Republic (and beyond) to speak and write Czech with more confidence — in a supportive, friendly, but structured way.

**Czech Buddy** is my teaching and education project focused on:
- online Czech courses (1:1 and group)
- Czech exam preparation (Permanent Residence **A2**, Citizenship **B1**, and CCE A1–C1)
- language mentoring (clear plans, accountability, real progress)
- creating learning materials and courses
- proofreading and language support for foreigners (CV checks, writing corrections, interview preparation, etc.)
- Czech for expats and professionals
