  - my codes can be seen in the [Advent of Code 2022 repository](https://github.com/Scharka/AoC),
  - where my skills ends (things that I only have a very rough idea of so far): decorators, generators, inheritance
  
- 🤖 **ML/AI**: 
  - I have a basic intuition about different algorithms, I acquired it in the course [Applied Machine Learning](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/phil/jaro2022/PLIN068)
  

<h4 align="left"> I am occupied with</h4>

  
- 👩‍🎓 I’m working on master's thesis on information extraction from food menus 📖 and preparing to finish my **Computational Linguistics** studies at Faculty of Arts at Masaryk university, Brno
- 🔍 **I’m looking for the first full-time job / part-time job / side projects / internship 🤩**
  - Do you have a job that I might be a good fit for? Feel free to contact me, I am open to a range of opportunities.
  - I feel like I would be most beneficial in a medium-sized company to which I could already be of some value and where I could grow to more technical/professional positions or positions that would be a good fit to my skills/abilities
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Czech language and I enjoy spreading it around - I teach Czech to foreigners. 👩‍🏫 I also know too much about the language to be a grammar Nazi, so don't worry!
